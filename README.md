# quake experiments

this repo used to contain folders, but those folders grew their own wings elsewhere...

- [fogo-sh/quakeless-ii](https://github.com/fogo-sh/quakeless-ii) - just enough stuff to start creating your own _fully_ custom games with quake 2
- [fogo-sh/pak-adventure](https://github.com/fogo-sh/pak-adventure) - pak file viewer

places of note:

- [ranguli/awesome-quake](https://github.com/ranguli/awesome-quake) - _A curated list of awesome Quake related goodness_
- [jackharrhy.dev/quake](http://jackharrhy.dev/quake) - my own ramblings / big list of quake things i am slowly growing
